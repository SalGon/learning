<h1>Day 6</h1>

<p>Continued learning JavaScript</p>

<p>It's harder than HTML and CSS for sure.</p>

<p>It will be a challenge to learn, but I will get it eventually!</p>

<h2>What I Did Today:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Continued learning JavaScript.</li>
    
</ul>

<p>Tomorrow I will continue the JavaScript adventure.</p>
