<h1>Day 2</h1>

<p>Today I did the full HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery Modules</p>

<p>It was a really productive day. Now the next step is to start the <strong>Basic Front End Development Projects</strong>.</p>

<p>Really thought Bootstrap would be more complicated, and I bet I just scratched the surface, but I liked it a lot, and I can't wait to start using it.</p>

<p>After I finish those I want to make my 1st page on GitHub to show all my progress, during this adventure.</p>
