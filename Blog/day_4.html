<h1>Day 4</h1>

<p>Today I worked on the Personal Portfolio project. It was the 2nd Basic Front End Development Projects</p>

<p>Had even more challenges with the Bootstrap grid positioning, but I figured it out.</p>

<p>It was a really good practice.</p>

<p>Here is the final product: <a href="https://codepen.io/SalGon/full/ZvKGLG/">https://codepen.io/SalGon/full/ZvKGLG/</a></p>
